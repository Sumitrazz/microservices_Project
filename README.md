# Microservices Project

This project demonstrates a basic **Microservices Architecture** using **Spring Boot**, **Eureka Server**, and **API Gateway**. It includes multiple services communicating with each other and integrates with a database.

## 🚀 Project Structure

```

### ✅ Eureka Server
Acts as the service registry. All microservices register themselves here.

### ✅ API Gateway
Handles routing to appropriate services using service discovery through Eureka.

### ✅ Service A
A sample microservice that exposes REST APIs and connects to the database.

### ✅ Service B
Another microservice that consumes Service A's APIs via the API Gateway.

---

## 🔗 Service Communication

- All services register with the **Eureka Server**.
- **API Gateway** handles routing to each service using Eureka.
- Services use **RestTemplate** or **OpenFeign** for inter-service communication.

---

## 💻 Running the Project

1. **Start Eureka Server**
2. **Start API Gateway**
3. **Start Service A and Service B**

Each service will register with Eureka and be accessible via the API Gateway.
